# Study Drills

# 1. Comment each line and explain what it does

# 2. Type python into terminal use it as a calculator

# 3. Find someething you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.
#    filename is ex3sd3.py and it calculates my hours worked using the datetime module

# 4. Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers
